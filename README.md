# essence
Essence is a standard for the creation, use and improvement of software engineering practices and methods, which is maintained and published by the OMG international open standards consortium.

The spirit of Essence is to concentrate on the essential information and to optimize both the
technical and human aspects of engineering by providing super-lightweight practices, often distilled into a small handful of cards, that focus on outcomes and minimize production of documentation.

We provide below the following components:
- Essence Pocket Guide: A quick introduction to Essence (pdf format) from [http://www.ivarjacobson.com/];
- Essence Table (drawio format);
- Essence Cards Draw.io Library (xml format)
